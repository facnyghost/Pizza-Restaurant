**Description**


I built a web Application using Mern Stack (Mongo Express React Node) 
This Web app is divided into two main parts:
The first part(backend): Which consists of register and login methods for both user and administrators with different roles and APIs which is connecting to mongo atlas database and of course with full verification and error handles. 
in the part of the backend, I follow MVC Pattern. and I try to make the codebase as much as clean and elegant.
The second part (frontend): consists of an app react which is the main part for users of course. 
Frontend: Reactjs, Bootsrap 5
Backend: node.js, Mongodb, mongoose, Expressjs, Rest, and Braintree for payment gateways.
Autentication: JavaScript web token (JWT), Bcrypt-js


**Usage**


In order to use this App, you need terminal. You also need to download and install node.js ,npm and react. You will also need to signin to Mongodb.com. or just use mate database because i already allows access from any IP's. In addition, make sure npm install to update and add any package you will need after clone project. if you want just to see how the app works.
